    Implementing Sports team

    You have to implement 3 classes, School, Team, and Player, such that an instance of a School should contain instances of Team objects. 
    Similarly, a Team object can contain instances of Player class.

    You have to implement a School class containing a list of Team objects and a Team class comprising a list of Player objects.

    Task 1
        The Player class should have three properties that will be set using an initializer:
            ID
            name
            teamName

    Task 2
        The Team class will have two properties that will be set using an initializer:
            name
            players: a list with player class objects in it
        
        It will have two methods:
            addPlayer(), which will add new player objects in the players list
            getNumberOfPlayers(), which will return the total number of players in the players list

    Task 3
        The School class will contain two properties that will be set using an initializer:
            teams, a list of team class objects
            name

        It will have two methods:
            addTeam, which will add new team objects in the teams list
            getTotalPlayersInSchool(), which will count the total players in all of the teams in the School and return the count
