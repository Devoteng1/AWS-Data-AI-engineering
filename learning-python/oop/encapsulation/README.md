# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental programming technique used to achieve data hiding in OOP.

> Encapsulation in OOP refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit, that is, class.

Depending upon this unit, objects are created. Encapsulation is usually done to hide the state and representation of an object from outside.
A class can be thought of as a capsule having methods and properties inside it.

## Get and Set

In order to allow controlled access to properties from outside the class, getter and setter methods are used.

> A getter method allows reading a property’s value.

> A setter method allows modifying a property’s value.
