    Calculate Student Performance

    Problem statement
        Implement a class - Student - that has four properties and two methods. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into three tasks.

    Task 1
        Implement a constructor to initialize the values of four properties: name, phy, chem, and bio.

    Task 2
        Implement a method – totalObtained – in the Student class that calculates total marks of a student.

    Task 3
        Using the totalObtained method, implement another method, percentage, in the Student class that calculates the percentage of students marks. 
        Assume that the total marks of each subject are 100. The combined marks of three subjects are 300.
        Formula: percentage = (marks_obtained/total_marks) * 100
