    Implement Calculator Class

    Write a Python class called Calculator by completing the tasks below:

    Task 1
        Initializer
        Implement an initializer to initialize the values of num1 and num2.

    Properties
        num1
        num2
    
    Task 2
        Methods
            add() is a method that returns the sum of num1 and num2.
            subtract() is a method that returns the subtraction of num1 from num2.
            multiply() is a method that returns the product of num1 and num2.
            divide() is a method that returns the division of num2 by num1.

    Input
        Pass numbers (integers or floats) in the initializer.

    Output
        addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

    Sample input
        obj = Calculator(10, 94);
        obj.add()
        obj.subtract()
        obj.multiply()
        obj.divide()

    Sample output
        104
        84
        940
        9.4
